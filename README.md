A pi extension that ports codex's `unified_exec` session model: every bash
command becomes a long-lived session the LLM drives with writes and polls,
instead of a single blocking call the agent waits on.

Mirrors codex's `exec_command` + `write_stdin` tool surface, with small
pi-flavor additions (`set_on_exit`, `kill_session`, `list_sessions`).

## Highlights

- **Session-oriented, two-way I/O.** `exec_command` opens a long-lived
  session; the LLM keeps the `session_id` and drives the same process
  across turns by interleaving `write_stdin` writes and polls. Every
  byte the child prints is mirrored to an on-disk log file in parallel
  with the in-memory buffer, so the full history is recoverable via
  `read(log_path)` even after the LLM-visible tail truncates.
- **Independent process and attachment lifetimes.** Initial `exec_command`
  and input-bearing `write_stdin` calls yield within 30 seconds. Empty polls
  default to five seconds and accept finite relative durations without a
  built-in maximum. Human-requested `yield_until` waits use an absolute UTC
  deadline. Both return on exit, cancellation, or deadline; cancellation
  leaves the process alive. Multi-day waits re-arm timers safely and retain
  bounded output instead of accumulating it inside the waiting call.
- **Completion can resume the agent (opt-in).** `exec_command(on_exit: "wake")`
  (default is `"none"`) delivers exactly one follow-up model prompt (bounded
  exit metadata, no raw output) when a backgrounded process exits while
  nothing is observing it — completions seen directly by a tool result
  consume the wake instead. `set_on_exit` disarms or re-arms wake without
  killing the process (including coordinator tombstones after eviction);
  `list_sessions` and the running-session UI surface `wake_armed` / `[wake]`.
- **Compact, bounded output with complete recovery.** Every output-bearing
  result—including `kill_session`—is tail-capped at 50 KiB / 2000 lines before
  it reaches model context or persisted details. All five tools have explicit
  TUI renderers; child output defaults to a five-visual-line tail and expands
  with Pi's configured `app.tools.expand` binding. Model/result/TUI text strips
  terminal-control sequences; the complete raw stream remains available at
  `log_path`.
- **Default-on compact codemode previews.** A display-only wrapper bounds
  collapsed codemode results to ten visual rows, including object/settled
  output from any nested tool. Native execution and expansion are unchanged,
  no settings are needed, and Pi prints no replacement warning;
  `PI_UNIFIED_EXEC_COMPACT_CODEMODE=0` opts out.
- **Ctrl-C and other control bytes, not just stdin text.**
  `write_stdin` decodes C-style escapes (`\x03` Ctrl-C, `\x04` EOF,
  `\x1b[A` arrow-up, …) before writing, so the LLM can interrupt a
  stuck command or drive an interactive TUI — `chars_b64` covers the
  arbitrary-binary case.

## Why

Pi's built-in `bash` suits commands that run and exit. It can stream output
and benefit from Pi's cache warmer during long calls, but cancellation kills
the process tree. This extension provides reusable process handles, later
input, PTYs, and observation that can end without terminating the process.

Codex's alternative: every call opens a session, yields after a bounded
`yield_time_ms` with output-so-far plus a `session_id`, and the LLM polls or
drives the session on later turns via `write_stdin(session_id, chars, …)`. A
PTY is available for interactive programs (Python REPL, ssh, sudo, TUIs).

This extension keeps that session model while letting Pi own cache warming.
Attachment durations are not tied to a provider's cache lifetime.

## Install

Published on npm as [`pi-unified-exec`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pi-unified-exec).
Install via pi's package manager:

```bash
pi install npm:pi-unified-exec            # global (~/.pi/agent/settings.json)
pi install -l npm:pi-unified-exec         # project-local (.pi/settings.json)
```

Under Node, `pi install` fetches the optional
`@homebridge/node-pty-prebuilt-multiarch` package and its prebuilt binaries for
Linux, macOS, and Windows. Under Bun 1.4 or newer—including a
`bun build --compile` host—PTY mode uses Bun's native `Bun.Terminal` instead
and does not load that package. If the active runtime provides neither
backend, pipe mode (`tty: false`) still works and `tty: true` reports the
missing capability.

To try without installing:

```bash
pi -e npm:pi-unified-exec
```

Reload a running pi with `/reload`.

## Tools

### `exec_command`

Runs a command in a persistent session.

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `cmd` | string | — | Shell command. Required. |
| `workdir` | string | turn cwd | Working directory. |
| `shell` | string | `bash` | Shell binary. On Windows: `bash` if on PATH, else `powershell`. `cmd` / `powershell` / `pwsh` get shell-appropriate flags. |
| `tty` | boolean | `false` | Allocate a PTY (native `Bun.Terminal` under Bun; node-pty under Node). |
| `cols` | number | `120` | PTY width in columns (`tty: true` only; ignored for pipes). Clamped to [20, 500]. |
| `rows` | number | `30` | PTY height in rows (`tty: true` only; ignored for pipes). Clamped to [5, 300]. |
| `yield_time_ms` | number | `10_000` | How long this call stays attached waiting for output (an attachment window, not the command's lifetime), clamped to [250, 30_000]. |
| `on_exit` | `"none"` \| `"wake"` | `"none"` | Persistent per-session policy for exits nobody is observing. Prefer `"none"`. `"wake"`: one synthetic follow-up prompt resumes the agent — only when the human explicitly wants auto-resume. Change later with `set_on_exit`. |

Response body (short output, no truncation):

```
[still running]                     (or [exited])
session_id: 1                       (mutually exclusive with exit_code)
exit_code: 0                        (mutually exclusive with session_id)
signal: SIGTERM                     (optional, if killed)
log_path: /tmp/pi-unified-exec-1-5cc5e104.log
cwd: /home/you/project
wall_time_seconds: 0.502
chunk_id: a4f2c1
original_token_count: 37
output_bytes_total: 148            (cumulative bytes since spawn — compare across polls to detect stalls)
omitted_bytes: 0                   (only present when the 1 MiB in-memory retention dropped middle bytes)
tty: false
---
<captured stdout+stderr>
```

If a chatty process produces more than the 1 MiB in-memory retention between
polls, the middle is dropped and a marker is spliced at the exact omission
point (the full stream is always in `log_path`):

```
[... 3145728 bytes omitted here (output exceeded the 1048576-byte in-memory retention between polls; the full stream is in the session log file) ...]
```

When output exceeds the caps (50 KiB / 2000 lines), a footer is appended:

```
...tail of output...

[Showing lines 3900-4120 of 4500 (50.0KB limit). Full output: /tmp/pi-unified-exec-1-5cc5e104.log]
```

### `write_stdin`

Drives or polls an existing session.

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `session_id` | number | — | Required. |
| `chars` | string | `""` | Empty = pure poll; non-empty writes (after escape decoding) then polls. Mutually exclusive with `chars_b64`. |
| `chars_b64` | string | `""` | Base64-encoded bytes to write. Binary-safe. Mutually exclusive with `chars`. |
| `yield_time_ms` | number | `250` with input; `5_000` empty | Attachment window, not a process timeout. Input-bearing calls clamp to [250, 30_000]. Empty polls have a 5_000 minimum and no built-in maximum. Supply a non-negative finite number no greater than `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER`; fractional milliseconds round down. An explicit operator cap rejects larger relative polls. Mutually exclusive with `yield_until`. |
| `yield_until` | string | — | Absolute UTC deadline for an **empty poll only**, strict RFC 3339 UTC (`2026-07-21T18:30:00Z` or with `.mmm`; uppercase `Z`; no offsets/local time; real calendar dates only). **Only when the human explicitly asks** for a long attached wait or wall-clock deadline. The call stays attached until the process exits, the call is cancelled, or the deadline arrives — whichever is first. A past deadline is an immediate poll. No default max horizon. Mutually exclusive with `yield_time_ms` and with input bytes. |

#### Waiting on long-running commands — the rules

1. Use a finite `yield_time_ms` based on the expected job duration and how
   soon progress needs attention. Empty polls default to five seconds and
   have no built-in maximum. Keep waits short for interactive or indefinite
   processes. An attachment deadline never kills the process.
2. Use `yield_until` **only when the human explicitly asks** for a long
   attached wait or a wall-clock deadline on a **finite, non-interactive**
   command. Omit `yield_time_ms` and pass a future UTC timestamp ending in
   `Z`, computed from `tool_time_utc`. The call returns early on process
   exit; Esc leaves the process alive.
3. `on_exit` defaults to `"none"`. Use `"wake"` **only when the human
   explicitly wants** auto-resume on unobserved completion. If you armed
   wake by mistake or the job is abandoned, call
   `set_on_exit(session_id, on_exit: "none")` promptly (does not kill).
4. Combining wake with an observing `write_stdin` is safe: a completion
   observed directly by a tool result consumes the wake; a deadline or
   cancellation leaves the wake armed until disarmed or delivered.

**Never** use `yield_until` for REPLs, `sudo`, `ssh`, password prompts,
dev servers, file watchers, debuggers, or any indefinite/interactive
session — it is only for finite commands that exit on their own.

Both empty-poll forms use the same event-driven wait. The bounded head/tail
buffer retains output, the rolling TUI tail produces output-driven updates,
and the log receives the raw stream. Short relative polls update at most
four times per second; longer and absolute waits at most once per 30 seconds,
plus initial/final updates. Quiet waits have no periodic output heartbeat.
Absolute deadlines convert once to a duration; both forms then use monotonic
elapsed time, so wall-clock changes cannot stretch or shrink a wait.

Pi owns cache warming independently. Its default `streaming` mode can refresh
eligible caches during attached tool waits; `idle` also permits warming after
the agent settles. Warming is best-effort and can stop because of economics,
missing cache metadata, safety horizons, errors, or extension vetoes. A long
wait works even when warming is off, but the next request may miss cache.

This release changes wait/output collection, not archive policy. Raw logs are
still unbounded on disk; archive quotas and bounded log-write backlogs remain
[follow-up work](docs/IV-0002-output-lifecycle-and-rendering.md#output-archive-safety).

#### Wait/cap configuration

| Env var | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `PI_UNIFIED_EXEC_MAX_EMPTY_POLL_MS` | unset, no cap | Optional limit for empty relative `write_stdin` polls. May exceed 290 seconds. Positive values below `5_000` become `5_000`; fractions round down. Invalid, non-positive, non-finite, or unsafe values fail the relative poll instead of silently removing protection. Does not change human-explicit absolute waits. |

To retain the old limit, explicitly set `PI_UNIFIED_EXEC_MAX_EMPTY_POLL_MS=290000`.
Unset or blank now means no cap. Malformed explicit values previously fell back
to the built-in cap; they now report a configuration error.

#### Control bytes and escapes in `chars`

`chars` is decoded as a C-style escape string before being written to stdin.
This lets the LLM send control bytes the wire format (antml/JSON tool_use)
strips of their meaning otherwise.

| Escape | Produces |
|---|---|
| `\\n` `\\r` `\\t` `\\b` `\\f` `\\v` | LF CR TAB BS FF VT |
| `\\0` | NUL (0x00) |
| `\\a` | BEL (0x07) |
| `\\e` | ESC (0x1B) |
| `\\xHH` (2 hex) | single byte |
| `\\uHHHH` (4 hex) | Unicode char |
| `\\u{H…H}` (1–6 hex) | Unicode code point |
| `\\\\` `\\"` `\\'` | literal `\` `"` `'` |
| `\\X` not in the list above | preserved literally (both chars) |
| Raw bytes in the string | pass through untouched |

Examples:

```
write_stdin chars="\x03"          → Ctrl-C   (0x03)
write_stdin chars="\x04"          → Ctrl-D   (0x04)
write_stdin chars="\x1b:wq\n"     → ESC + ":wq" + LF     (vim save+quit)
write_stdin chars="\x1b[A"        → ESC + "[A"           (up arrow)
write_stdin chars="password\n"    → "password" + LF
write_stdin chars="C:\\\\temp"    → "C:\\temp"           (must escape \)
```

For arbitrary binary or when you want zero ambiguity, use `chars_b64`
instead:

```
write_stdin chars_b64="G3s6wgo="    → exact 5 decoded bytes
```

The two parameters are mutually exclusive — passing both rejects the call.
Malformed base64 also rejects.

### `set_on_exit`

Change `on_exit` policy **without killing the process**.

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `session_id` | number | — | Required. |
| `on_exit` | `"none"` \| `"wake"` | — | `"none"`: disarm pending wake (process keeps running; also works for coordinator tombstones after store eviction). `"wake"`: arm auto-resume if still running in the store. Too late once the session has already exited unregistered / already notified. |

Status tokens in the result: `disarmed`, `already_none`, `armed`,
`already_armed`, `too_late`. Unknown ids return `found: false`.

Use this when wake was armed by mistake, the approach was abandoned, or the
human no longer wants auto-resume. **Disarm cannot recall a follow-up that
was already queued to pi.** `kill_session` still both kills and suppresses
wake.

### `on_exit: "wake"` — completion notifications

Default is `"none"`. `exec_command(on_exit: "wake")` arms a per-session
completion policy once the call commits to returning a background
`session_id` (a command that finishes inside the initial yield returns its
exit directly and never arms a wake). Prefer arming only when the human
explicitly wants auto-resume; use `set_on_exit` to disarm later.

The exactly-once invariant:

> Terminal completion is delivered through a finalized tool result **or**
> it causes one synthetic model prompt — normally never both.

Mechanics:

- Any `write_stdin` call that could return terminal status takes an
  *observation lease*. An exit that lands while an observer is attached is
  held and returned directly by that call; the wake is consumed when pi
  finalizes the tool result (`tool_execution_end`). A result finalized as
  error/cancelled releases the lease and keeps the wake eligible.
- A relative/absolute deadline or a cancelled call releases the lease and
  leaves the wake armed; when the process later exits, exactly one
  follow-up prompt is sent.
- The prompt is delivered via `pi.sendMessage(…, { triggerTurn: true,
  deliverAs: "followUp" })`: it starts a turn if pi is idle and is queued
  as a follow-up if a run is active — it never steers or interrupts the
  current turn. Simultaneous completions are debounced into **one** bounded
  prompt.
- The prompt contains bounded execution metadata only (session id, exit
  code/signal, sanitized one-line command, cwd, elapsed time, log path,
  failure info) — never raw stdout/stderr. The exited session remains
  drainable via an empty `write_stdin` afterwards, and consuming that
  output never triggers a second wake.
- Suppression: `kill_session`, the `/unified-exec-sessions` command, LRU
  eviction of a live process, and `session_shutdown` all suppress the wake
  (before signaling). A kill that fails to land restores eligibility. A
  naturally-exited wake session that gets evicted before notification keeps
  a bounded tombstone snapshot so its one wake (with `log_path`) is still
  delivered — unless `set_on_exit … none` disarms that tombstone by id.
  `list_sessions` reporting the exit first counts as direct observation and
  suppresses a not-yet-queued wake.

Requires pi and TUI ≥ 0.99.1 (`agent_settled` extension event, used as a safe flush
point for pending/retried notifications; `outputSchema` / `structuredContent` for
codemode scripts).

### `kill_session`

Pi-flavor. Not in codex.

| Param | Type | Default | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `session_id` | number | — | Required. |
| `signal` | string | `"SIGTERM"` | Escalates to SIGKILL after 2s. Pass `"SIGKILL"` to skip the grace. On Windows any signal force-kills the process tree immediately. |

Signal names are normalized (`term`, `INT`, `sigkill` all work). Unknown
names are rejected with an error instead of silently no-opping.

The result uses the same bounded output envelope as `exec_command` and
`write_stdin`: `details.output` contains at most 50 KiB / 2000 lines of
terminal-inert plain text, `truncation` and `omitted_bytes` explain any loss,
and `log_path` points to the complete raw session stream. Explicit `operation`,
`status`, `running`, `killed`,
`escalated`, requested/actual signal, and process metadata distinguish session
identity from liveness. A failed kill remains registered and reports
`running: true`.

### `list_sessions`

Pi-flavor. Not in codex. Prunes exited sessions from the in-memory store, but
reports each of them one final time (with `running: false`, `exit_code` /
`signal`, and `log_path`) so exit information is never silently lost.

Each entry includes **`wake_armed: boolean`** (and the text listing marks
live armed sessions with `[wake]`) so the model can audit which sessions will
auto-resume on unobserved exit.

The response also carries **`tool_time_utc`** (text trailer + details) so the
model can compute a `yield_until` deadline from the trustworthy host clock
without an extra probing call.

## Command

- `/unified-exec-sessions` — human-facing escape hatch: lists live sessions in
  a selector (armed wakes show `[wake]`) and kills the chosen one (or all of
  them) without going through the model. Uses the same SIGTERM → 2s → SIGKILL
  escalation as `kill_session`.

## Flag

By default, this extension **removes pi's built-in `bash` tool** from the
active set at session start so the LLM is steered toward `exec_command` /
`write_stdin`.

- `--keep-builtin-bash` — preserve the built-in `bash` alongside the
  unified-exec tools. Useful if you've got skills or prompts that explicitly
  expect `bash(cmd, timeout)`.

## Codemode scripts

Every tool declares an `outputSchema` and returns a matching
`structuredContent`, so Pi codemode scripts receive an object instead of the
text envelope the model sees:

```js
const r = await tools.exec_command({ cmd: "npm test", yield_time_ms: 30000 });
if (r.running) text(`still running as session ${r.session_id}`);
else text(`exit ${r.exit_code}`);
text(r.output); // readable multiline output rather than the whole JSON object
```

`exec_command` and `write_stdin` resolve to `{ status, running, output,
truncated, session_id?, exit_code?, signal?, failure_message?, log_path?,
wall_time_seconds, note?, wait_status?, on_exit?, tool_time_utc? }`;
`kill_session`, `set_on_exit`, and `list_sessions` have matching typed shapes
(`src/script-result.ts`). `output` is the same bounded, terminal-inert tail as
`details.output`. Print `r.output` rather than the whole object: `text(r)`
serializes newlines as `\n` and turns the output into one long line.

Model-visible `content` and persisted `details` are unchanged.

### Default-on codemode display fix (0.12.1; warning-free since 0.12.2)

Pi 0.99.1's collapsed codemode preview counts logical lines before wrapping.
`text(r)` or `text({ i, ...settled })` creates one long JSON line, which can
wrap across the screen even though the result is collapsed. Pi 0.99.2 bounds
individual preview sections by visual lines, but many nested-call summaries
can still exceed a whole-result limit. This package registers codemode from
Pi's public codemode factory and changes **only its
result renderer**: after native wrapping, the collapsed result text component
is capped at ten visual rows, including nested-call summaries, spacers and
footer. Small native previews and expanded output stay unchanged. A configured
expansion hint and `Full output:` recovery footer remain visible when clipping;
long footer paths are width-truncated, with the complete path retained on
expansion.

**No setup.** The replacement is registered at session start, following Pi's
dynamic-tools pattern, so Pi keeps `builtin:codemode` loaded and prints no
replacement warning. Pi's tool registry uses the first extension in load order,
and configured packages load before built-ins, so this codemode is the one in
use; the built-in is the automatic fallback whenever this fix is off or fails.
If another extension's codemode takes precedence, or a future Pi has no native
result renderer to wrap, the package warns at session start and native display
remains.

The fix applies to **all codemode nested tools**, not only unified-exec. It does
not activate codemode, rewrite script/model results, change process output
bounds, patch Pi, or write your settings. The script-call renderer and separate
inline image components are outside this result-text cap. The replacement
honors `defaultTools: ["+codemode"]`, CLI tool selection, `codemode.mode`,
`codemode.inlineBudget`, native MCP activation and branch-local store/load.

**Upgrading from 0.12.1:** its `"-builtin:codemode"` exclusion is no longer
needed; remove it (or re-enable `codemode` under Built-in in `pi config`) so the
built-in stays available as a fallback. With the exclusion kept, the package
still supplies codemode and applies `defaultTools` itself, appending codemode
after the other active tools.

**Explicit opt-out**, for a different codemode replacement or native display:

```bash
PI_UNIFIED_EXEC_COMPACT_CODEMODE=0 pi
```

## TUI rendering

Custom `renderCall` and `renderResult` mirror pi's built-in `bash` tool
styling and add session-aware details:

**While streaming (live, updates every second):**
```
$ for i in {1..12}; do echo round $i; sleep 0.5; done (yield 2.5s · cwd: ~/project)
… 1 earlier lines
  round 2
  round 3
  round 4
  round 5

  elapsed 1.3s · session_id=2 · log: /tmp/pi-unified-exec-2-86b3f006.log
```

**After yield, session still alive:**
```
  yielded 2.5s · session_id=2 · log: /tmp/pi-unified-exec-2-86b3f006.log
```

**After process exits:**
```
  took 4.2s · exit_code=0 · log: /tmp/pi-unified-exec-1-5cc5e104.log
```

**write_stdin:**
```
⟳ poll → session_id=2 (yield 5.0s)               # empty chars
⟳ poll → session_id=2 (2h40m later)              # yield_until (live remaining)
» print(7*6)\n → session_id=1 (yield 1.0s)         # with input
» ^C → session_id=1 (yield 1.0s)                  # control byte
» (base64, 5 bytes) → session_id=1 (yield 1.0s)   # chars_b64 payload
```

**Absolute-wait footer** (while still attached) shows remaining time such as
`2h40m later` (ISO deadline stays in tool details for the model). Cancelled
waits mark `cancelled`; armed wakes may show `wake armed`.

**set_on_exit:**
```
set_on_exit session_id=2 → none
```

**kill_session** (collapsed by default):
```
kill_session session_id=2 signal=SIGTERM
... (147 earlier lines, Ctrl+O to expand)
last output line 1
last output line 2
last output line 3
last output line 4
last output line 5
  took 0.3s · killed session_id=2 · signal=SIGTERM · log: /tmp/...
```

**list_sessions** shows up to five compact entries while collapsed and all
bounded entries plus log paths when expanded.

**Running-session UI:** while any unified-exec process is still alive, the TUI
footer shows `unified-exec: N sessions running`. After `/tree` navigation, a
widget above the editor lists the live `session_id`s and commands (with
`[wake]` when auto-resume is armed) so the human sees that processes survived
branch navigation. The footer/widget refreshes as soon as a background session
exits; the exited session remains drainable via `write_stdin` until observed,
preserving the usual lazy cleanup semantics.

By design this display omits some metadata the LLM sees (`chunk_id`,
`original_token_count`, and tildified paths). Use the configured
`app.tools.expand` binding (Ctrl+O by default) to reveal the complete **bounded
result**. Expansion never reads an arbitrary-size log synchronously; use
`log_path` when the complete raw session stream is required. Raw PTY logs can
contain terminal mode/clipboard sequences, so inspect them through `read`, a
hex/escape visualizer, or another non-executing viewer rather than `cat`.

## Semantic notes

- **Early exit**: commands that finish in <150 ms never touch the session
  store. The response has `exit_code`, no `session_id`.
- **Session persistence between calls**: if a process exits after a tool call
  returns but before the next one, the session stays in the store. The next
  `write_stdin(session_id, …)` call will observe the exit and return
  `exit_code`, then remove the session; `list_sessions` reports it once with
  exit info before removing it. (Matches codex's `refresh_process_state`
  pattern.)
- **Spawn failures are diagnosable**: a nonexistent shell binary or `workdir`
  (async ENOENT from the OS) surfaces as `failure_message` in the response
  instead of a silent empty exit.
- **Shell-exit vs pipe-close**: a session reports "running" until the output
  pipe reaches EOF — the shell's own exit is not enough. Background
  processes that inherited stdout/stderr (or a backgrounded `cd … && cmd &`
  chain whose subshell keeps waiting) hold the pipe open, so the session
  stays `[still running]` after its shell is gone. Such results carry a
  `note` explaining the state and how to detach (`(cd dir && cmd >log 2>&1
  </dev/null) &`, `setsid cmd >log 2>&1 </dev/null &`) or end it with
  `kill_session`; `list_sessions` marks them `(shell exited, pipe held)`.
- **Closed stdin is safe**: a child that closes its stdin no longer crashes
  the host on EPIPE; follow-up `write_stdin` calls report
  `failure_message: "stdin write failed: …"` when bytes can't be delivered.
- **External abort (Esc)**: breaks the current call's wait but does not kill
  the session. The next turn can still drive it. For either empty-poll form the
  cancelled call reports `wait_status: cancelled`, does not drain buffered
  output, and leaves an armed `on_exit: "wake"` eligible.
- **Empty-poll races**: if exit, cancellation, and deadline land almost
  simultaneously, actual process exit wins whenever the session is already
  terminal when the result is assembled.
- **Session shutdown**: all live sessions are terminated with SIGTERM; after a
  1s grace, survivors (e.g. children that trap SIGTERM) are SIGKILLed so
  detached process groups don't outlive pi. (Use the separate
  `bash-background` extension if you need true disown.)
- **LRU eviction**: at `MAX_SESSIONS`, the oldest non-protected session is
  evicted. The 8 most-recently-used are never pruned. Exited sessions are
  preferred as victims.
- **Head+tail output buffer**: per session, up to 1 MiB retained, split 50/50
  between the beginning and end of the output stream. A separate 32 KiB
  rolling tail window feeds streaming `onUpdate` events during waits.

## Worked examples

### 1. Dev server (never exits on its own)

```
> exec_command(cmd="npm run dev", yield_time_ms=5000)
[still running]
session_id: 1
---
> Server listening on :3000

> exec_command(cmd="curl -s localhost:3000/health", yield_time_ms=2000)
[exited]
exit_code: 0
---
{"ok": true}

> write_stdin(session_id=1, chars="", yield_time_ms=10000)      # poll dev server
[still running]
---
  GET /health 200 in 3ms

> kill_session(session_id=1)                                    # stop it
Killed session 1 (pid 12345) with SIGTERM — exit_code=143
```

### 2. Long-running non-interactive job

```
> exec_command(cmd="npm test", yield_time_ms=1000, on_exit="wake")
[still running]
session_id: 2
completion_notification: armed
tool_time_utc: 2026-07-21T08:30:00.000Z
---
> test suite started

> write_stdin(session_id=2, yield_until="2026-07-21T10:30:00Z")  # only if human asked for long attach
[exited]
exit_code: 0
wait_mode: absolute
wait_status: completed
completion_delivery: direct
on_exit_wake: consumed
---
> all tests passed

# If the job is abandoned before exit:
> set_on_exit(session_id=2, on_exit="none")   # disarm; process keeps running
set_on_exit session_id=2 on_exit=none → disarmed …; wake not armed

> list_sessions()
# live armed sessions include wake_armed: true / "wake" in the text listing
```

For ordinary progress, choose a finite relative wait such as
`write_stdin(session_id=2, yield_time_ms=900000)`. It returns early on exit;
there is no need to split it into 290-second polls. Use `yield_until` only
when the human explicitly wants a long attached wait or wall-clock deadline. If
the deadline arrives (or the wait is cancelled) while the process is still
running and wake is still armed, one follow-up prompt is delivered when the
process exits — unless you `set_on_exit … none` first.

### 3. Interactive Python REPL

```
> exec_command(cmd="python3 -q", tty=true, yield_time_ms=1500)
[still running]
session_id: 1
---
>>>

> write_stdin(session_id=1, chars="print(7*6)\r", yield_time_ms=1000)     # \r = Enter (portable; \n fails on Windows)
[still running]
---
42
>>>

> write_stdin(session_id=1, chars="exit()\r", yield_time_ms=1000)
[exited]
exit_code: 0
```

### 4. `sudo` (interactive password)

```
> exec_command(cmd="sudo -k && sudo whoami", tty=true, yield_time_ms=1500)
[still running]
session_id: 1
---
[sudo] password for wr:

> write_stdin(session_id=1, chars="<password>\r", yield_time_ms=2000)
[exited]
exit_code: 0
---
root
```

## Tests

From the repo root:

```bash
npm install
npm test                 # strict typecheck + unit/integration + offline actual-CLI tests
npm run test:tui         # isolated tmux acceptance, skips if tmux is unavailable
```

The CLI/TUI fixtures use a local scripted provider, not a live model. Set
`PI_UNIFIED_EXEC_TEST_CLI=/path/to/pi/dist/cli.js` to exercise another published
Pi version without changing package dependency pins.

Tests cover yield_until timestamp validation (strict RFC 3339 UTC subset,
impossible-date rejection, far-future acceptance, `tool_time_utc` on errors),
event-driven long-wait behavior (monotonic re-arm, multi-day timer chunking,
cancellation, timer/listener cleanup, rate-limited streaming with no idle
heartbeat), the CompletionCoordinator (exactly-once invariant, observation
leases, `setOnExit` disarm/re-arm including tombstones, kill/eviction/shutdown
suppression, batching, bounded sanitized wake content), wake + yield_until +
`set_on_exit` + `wake_armed` listing integration through the real tools, plus
the pre-existing
coverage: HeadTailBuffer (direct port of codex's unit
tests), Notify/Gate/sleep, collectOutputUntilDeadline (10 scenarios incl.
abort-listener/timer cleanup), SessionStore LRU (10 scenarios), truncateTail
(ported from pi, 13 scenarios), unescapeChars (14 scenarios for
`\xHH`/`\uHHHH`/`\u{…}`/unknown escapes/Windows path footguns),
chars-encoding end-to-end (13 scenarios covering raw bytes, escape decoding,
chars_b64 binary-safety, and mutual-exclusion errors), signal-name mapping,
full e2e pipes (45+ scenarios incl. log-file retention, byte/line truncation,
a delayed 4000-line kill drain, renderer registration, spawn-failure
diagnostics, EPIPE safety, exited-session reporting, shutdown SIGKILL
escalation, onUpdate streaming, and the `/unified-exec-sessions` command), pure
output-envelope, terminal-control, cache-refresh, and collapse/expand/re-collapse
renderer coverage, Node PTY mode (simple command, Python REPL drive, Ctrl-C
injection, cmd.exe verbatim payload), a dependency-free Bun PTY runtime fixture
(input/output, geometry, quoted/non-ASCII argv, shell command, normal exit, and
kill), shell selection (per-shell argv construction, PATH lookup with synthetic
PATH fixtures, Windows bash→powershell fallback both branches, WSL-stub
exclusion, binary resolution caching), Node PTY loader guard (`EXPECT_PTY`
assertion so a prebuild load failure is a red build, ConPTY disposal mock), and
cmd.exe quoting
e2e (operators, embedded quotes, %VAR%, parentheses, pipes), and codemode
script results (`outputSchema`/`structuredContent` for all five tools), native
codemode renderer cache/width/expansion, and offline actual-CLI parity for
settings, default activation with and without the legacy exclusion, explicit opt-out, store/load and local-stdio MCP.
Real-tmux acceptance also exercises object/settled/multiline script output at
40/80/100 columns, regular/fullscreen, three themes and spill-path recovery.

CI runs the Node suite on Node 22/24 and the Bun PTY fixture both from source
and as a compiled executable on Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows runners.

## Improvements over codex

This port preserves codex's session semantics but borrows two pieces from pi's
built-in `bash` tool that codex itself treats as unsolved:

**1. Full output retained on disk, not just head+tail in memory.**
Codex caps each session's in-memory buffer at 1 MiB and silently drops middle
bytes once it fills. We mirror every byte the child writes to
`/tmp/pi-unified-exec-<sid>-<random>.log` in parallel with the in-memory
buffer. The file has the complete, unaltered stream across the entire
session's lifetime; nothing is lost.

**2. LLM-visible output is tail-capped at pi's `bash` defaults (50 KiB or
2000 lines, whichever hits first), with a pointer to the log file.**
Codex serializes up to ~40 KiB to the LLM on every call (10 000 tokens of
middle-truncated text). That's a bounded-but-generous context cost per call,
and codex gives the LLM no way to recover the dropped middle. Our port
tail-truncates per pi's `bash` tool and exposes `log_path` in the response
header and tool-call details. When the LLM wants the full output it can
`read(log_path)` with pi's file-read tool.

As a consequence we dropped codex's `max_output_tokens` parameter on both
`exec_command` and `write_stdin`. The per-call cap is fixed; if the LLM
wants a tighter snippet it can ask for a specific slice by reading from the
log file.

| | codex | this port |
|---|---|---|
| Session in-memory retention | 1 MiB head+tail (lossy) | 1 MiB head+tail (lossy) — same |
| **Session full retention** | **none** | **full log file on disk** |
| LLM-visible per call | ≤40 KiB, middle-truncated | ≤50 KiB / ≤2000 lines, tail-truncated |
| LLM-visible truncation recovery | none | `read(log_path)` for the full stream |
| Per-call `max_output_tokens` knob | yes (default 10 000) | removed; fixed 50 KiB/2000 lines |
| Truncation marker in body | `…N tokens truncated…` | `[Showing lines X-Y of T. Full output: …]` |

The `log_path` field is exposed in every `exec_command` and `write_stdin`
response (as a header line and in tool-call details), plus in `list_sessions`
per-entry and in `kill_session` details.

Log files live in `/tmp/` and are never auto-deleted (they're just regular
files; `/tmp` cleanup is the OS's problem). If you run the same session to
completion and never revisit the log, it'll linger until your next reboot.

## Other pi-flavor additions

- `set_on_exit`, `kill_session`, and `list_sessions` tools (codex has none of
  these). `list_sessions` exposes `wake_armed`; the running-session widget and
  `/unified-exec-sessions` picker mark armed wakes with `[wake]`.
- `write_stdin` also works in pipe mode (`tty: false`), not just PTY.
  Useful for feeding lines to `jq`, `sort`, etc.
- Streaming `onUpdate` tail window for TUI rendering during yields, plus
  human remaining-time labels for `yield_until` waits.
- Running-session UI: footer status while processes are alive and a
  post-`/tree` widget so humans can see that processes survived branch
  navigation. The UI refreshes immediately on background session exit without
  pruning the exited session before the next `write_stdin`/`list_sessions`.
- Explicit `renderCall` / `renderResult` coverage for all five tools, mirroring
  Pi bash's styling: command banners, five-visual-line output tails, configured
  `app.tools.expand` hints, compact session inventories, live elapsed counters,
  process/kill status footers, and `⟳ poll` / `» input` banners.
- `cwd`, `command`, and `yield_time_ms` are surfaced in tool-call details
  (and `cwd` in the LLM-visible response header) for easy debugging.

## What's not here (vs codex)

- No sandbox / approval / permission stack (pi doesn't have one).
- No network-proxy integration.
- No persistence across pi restarts. (Processes are terminated on
  `session_shutdown`.)
- No live PTY resize (SIGWINCH) handling — `cols`/`rows` are fixed at spawn.

## Windows

Supported — both pipes and PTY mode. `tty: true` uses ConPTY through the
runtime-native backend: `Bun.Terminal` under Bun 1.4+, or
`@homebridge/node-pty-prebuilt-multiarch` under Node.

- **Default shell**: `bash`, located with an extended probe (first hit
  wins, cached):
  1. `PI_UNIFIED_EXEC_BASH` env var (explicit override)
  2. `bash` on PATH — System32's `bash.exe` (the WSL stub) is deliberately
     excluded: it runs commands inside a WSL distro's filesystem view, not
     Windows'
  3. **derived from `git.exe` on PATH** — Git for Windows' default
     installer puts only `Git\cmd` (git.exe) on PATH, not `Git\bin`, so
     "git works but bash doesn't" is the most common setup; the probe
     walks up from git.exe and finds `<GitRoot>\bin\bash.exe`
  4. well-known install roots (`%ProgramFiles%\Git`, `%ProgramW6432%\Git`,
     `%ProgramFiles(x86)%\Git`, `%LocalAppData%\Programs\Git`)
  5. `powershell` fallback, with a one-time warning

  When bash is found off PATH (steps 3–4), a one-time info notice shows the
  path being used. Derived hits use `bin\bash.exe` — Git's launcher, which
  sets up MSYS PATH so `ls`/`grep`/`sed` work in the child — never
  `usr\bin\bash.exe`. Explicit `shell: "bash"` gets the same extended
  probe. Explicit `shell: "cmd"` (`/d /s /c`, verbatim command line —
  works in both pipe and tty mode) and `shell: "powershell"` / `"pwsh"`
  (`-NoProfile -NonInteractive -NoLogo -Command`) are supported. Bare shell names are resolved to
  an absolute path before spawning (failing closed if unresolvable), so a
  binary planted in an untrusted workdir can't shadow the real shell.
- **No POSIX signals.** Every kill — `kill_session`, `/unified-exec-sessions`,
  LRU eviction, `session_shutdown` — is a force tree-kill
  (`taskkill /pid <pid> /T /F`), regardless of the requested signal name.
  Killed processes report `exit_code: 1` rather than `signal: SIGTERM`, and
  escalation-to-SIGKILL never happens (the first kill is already final).
  Tree-kill matters: killing only the shell would orphan grandchildren, which
  also hold the stdio pipes open and delay exit detection.
- **Log files** live in `%TEMP%` (`os.tmpdir()`), same naming scheme.
- **Kill failures are reported, not hidden.** If `taskkill` doesn't land
  (access denied, protected process), `kill_session` says so and the session
  stays registered for retry — it is never silently dropped while the
  process lives.
- **Supply-chain note (Node PTY prebuilds).** This does not apply to Bun's
  built-in terminal backend. Under Node, npm's lockfile integrity covers the
  `@homebridge/node-pty-prebuilt-multiarch` JS payload, but the native ConPTY
  binary is fetched at install time by `prebuild-install` from the package's
  GitHub releases (TLS, homebridge org); those bytes are not covered by an npm
  digest. The dependency is pinned exactly; stricter Node deployments can
  vendor the prebuild or build node-pty from source.
- Ctrl-C injection (`write_stdin chars="\x03"`) works in PTY mode — ConPTY
  translates it into a real console interrupt. In pipe mode it's just a byte,
  as on every platform.
- **Submit tty input with `\r`, not `\n`.** POSIX terminals map CR→NL so
  both work there, but legacy Windows console line input only executes on
  CR — with `\n` a REPL echoes the text without running it.
  `write_stdin chars="print(6*7)\r"` is portable; `\n` is not.
