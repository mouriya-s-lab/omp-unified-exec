# omp-unified-exec fork

Fork of [iamwrm/pi-unified-exec](https://github.com/iamwrm/pi-unified-exec) for
[oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi) (omp). omp forked from Pi in early
2026 and loads Pi packages through a compatibility layer that only covers part of
Pi's newer API, so upstream releases can stop loading on omp.

Install: `omp install https://github.com/mouriya-s-lab/omp-unified-exec`.
Remove an existing `pi-unified-exec` first (`omp plugin uninstall pi-unified-exec`):
both register `exec_command` and the other unified-exec tools.

## Customizations

| Change | Files | Why | Upstream |
|---|---|---|---|
| Package name `omp-unified-exec` | `package.json` (`name`, `repository`, `homepage`) | omp names the plugin after the package | Fork-only |
| Compact codemode fix reads `createCodemodeExtension` off the module namespace and stays off when the host lacks it | `src/codemode-render.ts`, `tests/codemode-render.test.ts` | Since 0.12.1 a named import of Pi's codemode factory fails to link on omp, which has no codemode; the whole package then fails plugin validation | Ready as branch `fix/codemode-host-guard` (upstream `main` + this change only). Upstream restricts PRs and issues to collaborators until 2027-01-22 (its `interaction-limit-reminder.yml`), so opening the PR was rejected; open it once the limit lifts |

Environment variables (`PI_UNIFIED_EXEC_*`), tool names and source layout are
unchanged, so other omp plugins that import `src/*` keep working after the path
moves from `node_modules/pi-unified-exec` to `node_modules/omp-unified-exec`.

## Repository state

- `Publish to npm` and `Interaction limit reminder` are disabled with
  `gh workflow disable`: the fork publishes nothing to npm, and the reminder
  tracks upstream's own interaction limit. This is repo state, so syncing the
  workflow files back in does not re-enable them.
- `Sync upstream` (`.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml`) merges `upstream/main`
  into `main` daily through PRs gated on `CI`.

## Expected sync conflict

`name` sits on the line next to `version`, and git treats edits to adjacent lines
as a conflict. Every upstream release bumps `version`, so its sync arrives as a
review PR. Resolve it by keeping `"name": "omp-unified-exec"` and taking upstream's
`version`.

Once upstream carries the codemode change, drop its row above; the rename is the
only customization meant to stay.
